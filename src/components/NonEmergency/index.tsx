              How much does medical and hospital transport cost?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-[#6F7174]">
              There are a few things we will need to consider when we build your
              quote, such as the length of your journey, how many CPR-qualified
              team members we will need to deploy, and what specific care needs
              you have. But don’t worry, it will all be laid out for you in
              writing with no surprises.
            </p>
            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl">
              How many people can you provide non-emergency medical
              transportation for?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-[#6F7174]">
              So that we can provide the most comfortable journey possible, we
              tend to allow a very small number of people onboard. So this means
              the person being transported, of course, plus an agreed friend or
              family member. Talk to us if anyone else special would like to
              come, such as a family pet, and we’ll see what we can do.

              Simply click the link at the bottom of our page to see our contact
